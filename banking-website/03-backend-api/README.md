# 03 - Backend API (Express, coming soon)

A placeholder for the real API that will serve account data, transfers, notifications, and admin tools. The `src/server.js` file is scaffolded for future lessons.

When ready, install dependencies and run `node src/server.js`. Until routes are added, use Stages 1 and 2 with mocked data. For the full learning path and troubleshooting, see the root `root-README.md`.
